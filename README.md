# Krish Learnings

This repo is a curated log of what I am learning and validating hands on.
It is written for quick scanning by teammates and future me.

## What you will find here
- Short, practical notes
- Commands and examples I have tested
- Common pitfalls and how I resolved them
- Links to official docs when useful

## Structure
- `LEARNINGS.md` is the main index of topics and notes.
- Optional: topic folders (ex: `git/`, `linux/`, `kubernetes/`) if a topic grows.

## How I update this repo
1. Create a branch for a new topic or update
2. Add notes with reproducible steps
3. Commit with a clear message
4. Push and open a PR when needed
